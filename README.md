# PulseDeck Presenter
> **AI-Powered Presentation Generation for Adobe Express**

Freelancers and agencies spend hours manually creating on-brand decks. PulseDeck automates this in minutes.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
- **Current Workflow:** Teams struggle with creating consistent, brand-aligned presentations, often starting from scratch or fighting with rigid templates.
- **Time Wasted:** Manual deck creation takes **2-4 hours per deck** on average.
- **Solution Gap:** Existing AI presentation tools lack deep integration with **Adobe Express**, forcing users to export/import assets and losing brand consistency.

## 💡 What is PulseDeck Presenter?
PulseDeck Presenter is an **Adobe Express add-on** that turns a brief, URL, or brand kit into a structured, on-brand presentation in under **2 minutes**.

### How it Works
1. **Input:** User pastes a text brief, URL, or meeting notes.
2. **Analyze:** AI analyzes the content to extract key points and structure.
3. **Generate:** Creates a full deck outline with suggested layouts.
4. **Refine:** Opens directly in Adobe Express for final editing with full creative control.

### Key Differentiator
Seamlessly integrates with **Adobe Express**, automatically applying your **brand kit** (colors, fonts, logos) while giving creators full editing capabilities—unlike other "black box" AI tools.
